abstract: |
  Many of the actions proposed in the national agenda to reach the SDGs could have implications for AMR. Therefore, alignment between the national action plan on AMR and SDGs is imperative to reduce duplication and increase the efficiency of interventions aimed at addressing AMR drivers by maximizing resources and expertise sharing. However, while many countries recognize the need to align the two agendas, the question remains: how should this be done? Currently, there is little scientific understanding of how policies related to these two agendas are likely to interact. As a result, the extent of synergistic and antagonistic interactions between proposed actions explicitly aimed at addressing AMR and the SDGs is mostly unexplored. In this study, we will assess the potential synergies or trade-offs between actions addressing AMR drivers proposed under these two frameworks. This will allow us to gain many valuable insights, such as identifying set of policies required to effectively address AMR, which will help governments coordinate policies across sectors and agencies to limit AMR in a comprehensive manner.
